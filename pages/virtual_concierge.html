            Perhaps the most personal element of the application, amongst other things this page will give directions for movement within
            the station and on the platforms, guiding passengers to the quietest, least crowded areas of the train. This
            will benefit everyday commuters who value a seat on their journey, and occasional travelers or tourists who may
            be liable to getting lost in large stations such as Clapham Junction.
            <br><br> The other key feature of the "Virtual Concierge" will be to allow travelers to order their morning coffee
            or croisant ahead of time. This capacity has the opportunity to be extended to services such as dry cleaning,
            and along with the sale of customer data, will be a large source of income for the application as a result of
            the royalties that the service would command.
